Hi all,

This week's focus was balancing, removing, and adding stuff for the third character!
The plan is to keep refining the character and release it into main branch once all of the art assets and animations are in later this month. We would like to thank all of our players assisting us in testing the character so far in the beta branch. For those interested, you can find more details about the beta branch and testing in the [previous announcement.](https://steamcommunity.com/games/646570/announcements/detail/1667898210977004105)
