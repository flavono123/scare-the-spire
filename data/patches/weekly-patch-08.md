A wild patch has appeared!

This patch brings in a few big features. These features are in an early stage so please bear with us. Also, it's a good time to give feedback! We like feedback!



### Leaderboards
Leaderboards are here! Compete with your friends in a few categories such as High Score, Consecutive Wins, and Fastest Victory. We'll be adding more features and filters as we push towards release.

**Note: **Scores for the leaderboards will be RESET each week as balance and content changes will come in every week.



### Score System
To go along with the leaderboards, the score system has been reworked to give  bonuses for interesting circumstances!
