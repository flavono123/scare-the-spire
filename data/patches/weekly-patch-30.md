## Content

Hey all,

This week we experimented a lot with Endless mode while incorporating more Act 3 content.

### Endless
We believe the feedback gathered from trying out new mechanics in Endless mode have given us a good direction to work towards.

### Custom Seeds
Custom seeds have been popular so UI improvements and surprises are coming!

### Controller Support
Lots of bug fixes, quality of life improvements, and minor improved compatibility has been added. Currently, Slay the Spire supports controllers with DirectInput support but we're looking into utilizing the Steam Input API as well.

### Community Fanart!
We really enjoy showcasing all this artwork since it makes our patch notes more colorful! If you want your art showcased, just give us a shout on our twitter [@MegaCrit.](https://twitter.com/megacrit)
