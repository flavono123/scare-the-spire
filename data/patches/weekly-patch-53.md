Happy holidays!

While things are slower due to winter festivities and gatherings, we're pushing ahead with bug fixes and visual improvements! Steam Workshop support is almost ready but we're taking a few days off for the holidays.
The next patch will be on January 3, **2019.**

As a reminder, there will be a price increase after the current Winter Sale as detailed in [last week's patch.](https://steamcommunity.com/games/646570/announcements/detail/2796070940829591158)
