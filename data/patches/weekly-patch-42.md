Hey everyone,

Breaks are good. But patches are good, too!
This patch brings in updates for our older low-res Power icons, additional SFX, and bug fixes.

### Power Icon Updates
The newer icons are higher resolution and some have been reworked for clarity.
Here's a packed texture showing off all of our power icons!


### Community Fan Art
Art is nice! There's a lot more in the Artwork section of our [Steam Community,](https://steamcommunity.com/app/646570/images/) too.
