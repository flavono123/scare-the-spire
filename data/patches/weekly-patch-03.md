Hello hello,

It's that time of the week! We first want to address the huge influx of new players, hello and welcome! The priority for localization dramatically changed this week. We are working as fast as we can with some companies to translate the game as soon as possible.

This week's focus was primarily on balance (as you may have noticed from the title) but you'll notice a few goodies as well.

### Hotfixes
- Orrery is temporarily removed because it crashes.
- Post-combat auto-saving is disabled because it has some issues.
- Fixing some monsters not properly loading from earlier version to new version.
- Fixed issue where after choosing something at Neow, the game would crash.
- If something goes wrong with monster IDs in save files, an apologetic slime will now appear.
- Book of Stabbing was appearing in normal enemy rooms and stabbing everyone to death, we are truly sorry for the suffering.
### Content
- New boss relic: Black Star.
- New boss relic: Snecko Eye.
### UI and Effects
- Adding letterboxing logic for unusual aspect ratios (for you weird monitor fullscreen folks). May have some issues.
- Bash's description gets updated to be consistent with other cards.
- Clarifying "You Are Nothing" achievement condition.
- Consistency for discard-to-play green cards' wording.
- HandCardSelectScreen's cards now animate 2x faster so you don't wait for cards to animate + reduces odd confirm behavior instances.
- Mark of Pain wording improvements.
- New auto-save created after choosing an option at Neow.
- New auto-save created post-combat (when the reward screen appears).
- Updated wording of Well Laid Plans to be simpler.
- When confirming 1 card for handCardSelect, we now say Confirm Card To <X>. Used to be Confirm Cards.

### Balance
