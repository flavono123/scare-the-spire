## Content

Hey everyone,

It's nice and sunny here in Seattle.
This week's work was focused on balance, reworks, and bug fixes. Too many random issues were beginning to rack up.

### Third Character
We now have about 60/75 card art completed and we're putting on the final balance touches. Keep in mind that balance and changes will still occur after the character is released into the main branch.

### Controller Support
Work has begun to add controller support. Slay the Spire from a couch! Those who play 12 hours a day can also give your wrists a break (Tip: Remember to take a break every now and then). Our aim is to make it as intuitive and customizable as we can!
