Hello everyone,

### Release Date
Slay the Spire will be out of Early Access on January 23, 2019.
We'll reveal more on the future of Slay the Spire and Mega Crit Games on release.

### Price Increase
Anybody reading this probably owns the game. With the upcoming full release, there will be a price increase shortly after the upcoming Winter Sale so if you were planning on buying or gifting, it's a good time to do so!
