## Content

Hey everyone,

It's patch time! This week we focused on expanding content for Act 3 while continuing work on prepping the Soundtrack and Controller support.

### New Events
Two new events! The Nest can be found in Act 2, and Mind Bloom is in Act 3. No spoilers though.

### Controller Support
Mainly bug fixing, there were a bit more bugs than expected but it's getting pretty close to reaching the quality level and usability that we want. For those in helping us test out controller support, please opt into the [beta branch](https://steamcommunity.com/games/646570/announcements/detail/1462971926900801868) and provide feedback at our [Discord channel.](http://discord.gg/slaythespire)

### Localization
Greek has been added! If interested in helping out with translations, please visit the localization channel at our official Discord :).
