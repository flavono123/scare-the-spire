## Content

Hey everyone,

Patch 2.0 is finally here, hooray! This patch brings new cards, relics, potions, balance changes, reworks, bug fixes, performance improvements, and a 4th character.
The previous version of the game can still be played by selecting "v1.1 - 2019-17-07" found in the BETAS tab within Steam.

### The 4th Character
The Watcher has arrived to evaluate the Spire. She brings her training in the divine stances and a seeing staff to cast judgment upon the wicked Spire spawn.

Like the other characters, the Watcher comes with her own set of cards and a handful of unique relics.

A huge thanks to all the players who helped test the 4th character on the beta branch. All of your feedback, data, and reading various discussions really helped us test out new ideas and tweak the character rapidly!

### Potion Lab

We added many potions this time around so we also created a screen that allows you to view all the potions!
This can be found in the Compendium section of the main menu as the Potion Lab.
You can even look up the rarities of all the new and existing potions.

### Modding
This patch brings many changes to the main game along with some improvements for modding support. Mods compatible with V1.1 will likely need to be updated to continue working for V2.0. Update those mods!

If you need assistance with updating or want to get into modding yourself, come visit the #modding channel at the [Slay the Spire Discord Server](https://discord.gg/slaythespire)!

### Community Fan Art
Art is all around us. But there's also some fan art here, too!
