## Content

Hey everyone,

This week we spent time finishing and tweaking up some content while sorting through and incorporating beta art.

### Final Content
This will be available in the main branch next week. The additional music brought in with this content will also be added to the [Slay the Spire - Soundtrack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/877620/Slay_the_Spire__Soundtrack/) next week, along with the special track used in the Mind Bloom event.

### Beta Art
A ton of submissions were received, thank you! The beta art submissions will be open for 1 more week as we identified some cards with missing portraits. For information on participation and what this entails, please see the [previous weekly announcement.](https://steamcommunity.com/games/646570/announcements/detail/1706195930369690868)
