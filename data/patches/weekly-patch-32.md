## Content

Hello,

Hope everyone's having some fun and the sun! Taking a break in the shade to play Slay the Spire is nice, too :).

This week's focus is mainly on content and improving usability for Custom Mode.

### Face Trader
It's a new event! This event shows up in any Act and can give you 1 of 5 relics 
 exclusive to this event, we think it's facetastic.

### Shop Relics
The third relic sold by the merchant is now always a shop rarity relic. To prevent players from seeing too many familiar relics there, we added 5 new shop relics! (Spoilers in patch notes)

### Relic Overflow Paging


We noticed that relics got a bit too small when people were having fun testing the game's limits. To maintain a reasonable hitbox, we removed the shrink logic and replaced it with arrows to allow you to page through relics. We decreased the spacing a bit, so it can pack 25 relics per page.

### Community Fan Art
Didn't post any last time, sorry. Send us more! It's amazing to see the game's characters drawn (or created) in so many ways. Thank you!
