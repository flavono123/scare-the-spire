## Content

Hello,

This week's focus was on content creation and polish! With the completion of the animations for 3 new enemies, they have been unleashed into the Beyond!

### Act 3 Enemies
Three new enemies have been added into Act 3. This doubles the variety of enemies in Act 3!


*Three new ways to die*

### Relics
Five new relics have been added! We're still adding more content (as our beta players are aware) so stay tuned.


*The Hand Drill: A new shop-only relic*

### Custom Mode
We're glad that you're all enjoying Custom Mode. It's fun to experiment and see some crazy interactions.

This week we're adding in the Endless and Blight Chest mods, allowing players to keep modifying their decks and fight monsters that keep getting stronger.

We're looking into lowering the requirement to unlock Custom Mode, adding more goodies, and eventually expanding into supporting mods better (Steam Workshop?!). When we lower the unlock requirement, we're considering the removal of the special seeds. As always, let us know what you think in the comments or at our [official Discord.](http://discord.gg/slaythespire)

### Community Fanart
Hey, why is there only one this week?! Because you're making art but not pinging [@MegaCrit](https://twitter.com/megacrit), and saying you want it in the announcements, that's why. We want to see and post all your creations!
