## Content

Greetings,

This week's focus continues the trend of adding content to reach our content goals. On top of this, we took some time to examine various cards and relics for balancing. We appreciate your continued patience and feedback!

### Content
The main branch gets 4 new relics! The beta branch contains various relics, cards, and events. However,they still require testing, fine tuning, and art assets until they're officially available on the main branch. For our newer players, information on the beta branch can be found [here.](https://steamcommunity.com/games/646570/announcements/detail/1462971926900801868)

### What's Still Coming?
Lots! We still want to add (or are currently working on) a Save Slot system, Steam Workshop support, Steam Controller support, improving and adding various VFX, etc etc... and of course NO SPOILERS.

### Localization
Is the translation for your preferred language missing, lacking, or outdated? Well, the tremendous efforts of community translators are working tirelessly just for you. Help them out! Just visit our [official Discord server](http://discord.gg/slaythespire) and hop in the localization section! I'll draw you a cultist in return!
