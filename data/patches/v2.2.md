Happy Holidays!

We've got exciting collaborations, support for wider aspect ratios, performance improvements, and made a few balance changes to some cards.

### Improvements! Tweaks!
While we're awaiting news from our publishing and porting teams for the Android mobile release, we're bringing some more of the under-the-hood improvements to PC! This includes support for ultrawidescreen up to 21:9 and various hitbox and font size improvements for our touchscreen mode and general performance improvements.

### The Watcher joins Fraymakers

The Watcher is making an appearance in McLeodGaming's upcoming title: *Fraymakers*. Check them out and maybe [pitch in to their Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mcleodgaming/fraymakers-the-infinitely-replayable-indie-platform-fighter) if you want to see a crossover fighting game starring indie characters and a character creator. We think it's pretty cool!

### SteelSeries Game Sense Support

We collaborated with SteelSeries to bring lighting effects to your gaming peripherals. Very shiny stuff.

### Run Data

*Our approximation of what the charts will look like.*

We've been receiving a lot of requests for Slay the Spire run histories for data analysis projects. We've heard you! Our kind moderator and helper Jake/ilikeshiny (who's [working on his own game PogoChamp](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1357220/PogoChamp/) by the way) has rounded up 27gb of data and pinned it to our #data-analysis channel at the [Slay the Spire Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/slaythespire).

All of these answers and more can be found in this archive of 77 million ~~DEATHS~~ runs of Slay the Spire.
