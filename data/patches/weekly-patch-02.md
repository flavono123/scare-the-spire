## Content

Hey everyone,

First, I would just like to thank everyone for the positive feedback, bug reporting, and generally playing a ton of Slay the Spire. Our back end systems have been exploding from all of the love. Thank you!

The beta branch will be available when the improved save system is ready for testing. We hope this happens soon.

We try to devote an even amount of time to content, systems, and bug fixes (for our own sanity) so even if the new save system isn't ready, there are still goodies!

### Content
- New battle in the Exordium: So many slimes!
- New strong encounter in the Beyond: 2 shapes and a sphere.
### UI and Effects
- Dexterity potion description updated for clarity/consistency.
- Initial tip for Powers now show up when you encounter them as a Card Reward rather than in your hand.
- Mercury Hourglass description updated for clarity.
- Strength potion description updated for clarity/consistency.
- Updating The Library event's option to clarify that you choose 1 of 20 cards rather than the usual 3.
### Balance
- Dead Adventurer event can now only appear on floor 7 and above.
