## Content

Hey everyone! We hope everyone's getting some shade, it's actually too sunny.

This week's focus was on designing future content and a save slot system (which will be in beta soon). Some of the new content requires art or balance so they aren't in the main branch just yet.

### Localization
We now have support for Indonesian! We're always looking to add new languages. Did you know Slay the Spire is translated into 20 languages? It's pretty great, and all thanks to you! As always, you can speak to localization experts (and us!) at our [Discord.](http://discord.gg/slaythespire)

### Community Fanart
Honestly, this is the greatest thing we started adding to our weekly announcements.
