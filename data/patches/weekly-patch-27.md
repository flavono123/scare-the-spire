Hey world,

This week adds the long anticipated third character into the game!

### The Third Character
It's finally here! Those of you who tested out the character in beta, we sincerely thank you for your feedback and gameplay data. The first two characters took about a year of balancing and reworking, it really helps us work faster to get all of your input.

Edit: To unlock the new character, play a run as the Silent (win or lose).

**Content:**
- A new character with unique mechanics, keywords, and art.
- 75 Cards.
- 9 Relics.
- 3 Achievements.
- Additional lore in the Sensory Stone event.
### Controller Support
Still trying a few things here and there while fixing up critical issues and usability quirks. We aim to get this ready for main branch in a few weeks, but it's been quite challenging! We're learning a lot about controllers.

**Patch Notes**
