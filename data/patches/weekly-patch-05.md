Hey everyone,

### Chinese (Simplified) Community Translation
In today's weekly patch, you will find a community translation for Chinese (Simplified). Keep in mind that there is differing render logic so you may experience some issues. Please let us know if you see anything strange and we will do our best to fix it!



### Holiday Time Off
As we are nearing the holidays seasons we want to let you know that Weekly Patch 6 will NOT be coming next week but the week after (January 4, 2018).

Okay, patch notes time:

### Balance
- <50% hp logic becomes a bit more consistent, potential fix for Red Skull not triggering.
- Book of Stabbing is completely reworked. Lots more stabbing, and a lot less random.

- Card Crippling Poison+ gets buffed from 4 -> 5 Poison & Weak.
- Card Dash+ gets +1 damage and +1 Block.
- Card FlameBarrier+ gets buffed. Deals 2 more damage back.
- Forgotten Altar now gives you the Max HP before damaging you. This way you won't die if the damage hits you first.

- Innate keyword now says 'start each combat with' rather than 'start combat with'.

- Removed the 'items in red aren't implemented' msg in Settings as there are no unimplemented settings in there now.
- Removing +X Gold text which appears when gold rains from the sky.
- Slightly changed how patch notes are rendered.
- Text for resolution, fps, and language togglers are now centered (was left aligned).
- Updating description for Envenom power to mention unblocked dmg.
