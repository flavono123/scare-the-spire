## Content

Hey everyone,

It's patch day! 

### Card Library Tabs
We worked on a UI  to improve the Card Library. Players no longer need to scroll as much when trying to view cards. This is especially useful as we add more card-related content in the future.


### Card Quick Select
You can now select cards by pressing numbers 0 - 9. If you want to view the corresponding hotkeys, they can be turned on in the Game Settings. Here it is in action.


### Card Reworks
We've been working on a lot of cards over at Mega Crit headquarters for our third character. While in the process, we also reworked some of our most unpopular cards.

There will probably many reworks in the future so we're trying out a new format. Pictures!

### Reckless Charge
Reckless charge is now Common and shuffles a Dazed into your draw pile rather than making you Vulnerable.


### Immolate
Immolate now costs 2, deals considerably more damage, and shuffles a Burn into your draw pile.


### Wraith Form
Wraith Form is completely reworked to give you 3 turns of Intangible while progressively decreasing your Dexterity each turn.
