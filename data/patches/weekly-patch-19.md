## Content

Hey hey,
This patch brings in seeded runs and improvements to the dailies.

### Seeds
You can now set your starting seed. Now you can play the same run as your friend or streamer. You can also answer those "What if?" questions as the seed of all of your runs are now visible on the Run History screen. Simply input a seed from the character select screen.

Keep in mind that Seeded Runs will not post a score to the leaderboards or allow you to unlock achievements.



### Third Character Progress
Some of you may have noticed some lighter patches the last few weeks, our dev efforts have been focused mainly on a third character. Internal testing has begun recently and we've had good progress in making this character balanced, interesting, and fun!

If all goes well, we will be testing this character in our beta branch later this month. Thank you for your continued patience and support.
