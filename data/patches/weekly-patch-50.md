### One Year Anniversary! Hooray!
Did you know Slay the Spire was released into Early Access November 14, 2017?

We're aware that in our Early Access blurb it said the game would be released by now. Well, too bad- we decided to add much more than initially planned. Also, thank you for playing the game, spreading the word, and being genuinely awesome.

### Vacation
I'm taking a vacation so the next patch is December 6.

### Community Fan Art
So many drawings! It's really great to see all these characters drawn in different ways, doing different things. We're going to keep sharing it with everyone else :).
